								<p>Hello everyone, my name is Alex Zelaya! I'm intially from Los Angeles and I moved to San Francisco to attend San Francisco State University to persue my degree in Bachelor's of Science in Information Systems. During my time at SFSU, I took the opperutnity to work with other students in different applications such as Microsoft Excel, Access, MySQL, and Python.</p>
								<p> After graduating from SFSU, I immediately entered the workforce and wanted to pursue my interest in working with data and collaborating with others with a passion for data. To continue my efforts, I took the time to take online courses and developed personal projects to the many tools used by data analysts such as Microsoft SQL and Tableau. I'm always looking to learn more about the many tools revolving data. Regardless of how much I have worked on so far, I still want to continue to learn the many tools and hopefully spread my knowledge to other who are interested in learning about data.</p>
								<p>On a more personal level, I enjoy visiting museums, site seeing locations in the Bay Area, and catching up with friends to discuss some of our recent achievements. On my free time, I enjoy watching Action/Adventure movies and playing video games, either single player or with friends! So if you'd like to chat and connect about some about smiliar interests, don't hesistate to connect with me!</p>
								<p>Thank you, and I'm looking foward to connecting with you!</p>
